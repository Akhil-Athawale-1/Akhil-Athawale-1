- 👋 Hi, I’m Akhil Athawale, an E&TC engineer from Pune.
- 👀 I work on embedded devices and IoT edge device development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to manage large-ish projects single-handedly, since I see myself working for small companies without much manpower. Also, I'm learning about PLCs, ladder logic development and industrial control systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on embedded projects with medical or industrial applications.
- 📫 Shoot me an email - akhilathawale@gmail.com or athawaleakhil@protonmail.com. I respond 18*7.
